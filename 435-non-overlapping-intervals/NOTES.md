why do we choose the least end value as our initial choice  and arrange in ascending order of end values?
reason being we need to maximize our non overlapping intervals and choosing the least end values will always result in the probability of maximizing our intervals later to increase and will keep us in an advantageous position as we would now be able to choose the next immediate interval with its start value
and as the intervals are sorted in order of their end values we are sure of the fact that the values will be in increasing order
