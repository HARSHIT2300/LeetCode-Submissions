First solution is a naive solution where I am checking for all possibilities,it's also a backtracking solution only
​
the last solution is the one to be reffered to using a character pointer to the string and not using the substr func improves the time complexity
​
string word =  ;   word.c_str() is function that returns pointer to array of null terminated sequence of characters. string is null terminated
