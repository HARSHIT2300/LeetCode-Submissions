To the code, a change can be applied
In the first for loop i have inserted only those 1's in the queue that have atleast one adjacent cell as 0(out of 4 adjacent cells), set them as 1 and inserted them in the queue
Instead of this all the zeroes can also be inserted in the queue
and the code would run perfectly fine even without changing your BFS code in the while loop
