Moderate Problem
Understood it incorrectly at first. All the nodes that are part of some cycle if the directed graph and some other nodes that might be directed to a cycle of the directed graph would not be included in the ans.
​
nodes with cn key->node   value =1  here indicates the nodes which are part of some cycle or nodes that lead to any cycle of the directed graph
​
Also col[node] =1 will be for all the nodes that are currently active for the currently connected component
