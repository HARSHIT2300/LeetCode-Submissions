just a small variation of minimum window substring here the substring whose minimum winow has to be found out is not directly given in the question but has to be calculated/computed
​
i have used extra time of comparing each characters  i.e worst casr overhead of 26 in my solution O(2*N*26)
This can be improved to O(N*2)
this can be improved look for some yt video/LC discuss
